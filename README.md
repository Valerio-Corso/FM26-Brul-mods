# Mods
## [Faster match startup](https://github.com/Valerio-Corso/FM26-Brul-mods/releases/tag/faster-match-startup-v1.0.0)

Speed up entering a game by skipping the intro steps see https://x.com/brulululI/status/1984965205072224287

A config will be generated for customization. The most relevant is being able to auto skip to kick off or define a keybind that once pressed will skip to Kick off.

## [Manager free cam](https://github.com/Valerio-Corso/FM26-Brul-mods/releases/tag/manager-free-camera-v1.0.0)

Switch your camera to the manager and freely walk around the pitch [see](https://x.com/brulululI/status/1984387966421114986)

Still very WIP, might add animations/actions later on, as always a config will be generated for customization, keybind, mouse speed, fov, etc

Press F3 to switch to this camera, Right-mouse to pan camera around, mouse wheel to change fov and WASD to move
